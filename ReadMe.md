# Quiz Application

This project is a web-based quiz application with gamification features, built using Nextjs and styled with Tailwind CSS. It fetches quiz data from a provided API endpoint and presents it through an intuitive and engaging user interface.

## Project Overview

This application presents users with multiple-choice questions fetched from the API: `https://api.jsonserve.com/Uw5CrX`. Users select their answers, and upon completion of the quiz, a summary of their results, including the total score, is displayed. The application incorporates several gamification elements to enhance user engagement.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone (https://github.com/Sakshi4480/Internship-Assignment.git)
    cd quiz-app
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the development server and open the application in your browser.

## Implementation Details

This section provides a brief overview of how the new features were implemented.

### Timer

A timer was implemented using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks. The timer starts when a question is displayed and counts down. If the time runs out, the answer is considered incorrect.

### Streak Counter

The streak counter is maintained using a state variable that increments when the user answers correctly and resets to zero when they answer incorrectly.

### Badges

Badges are managed using the `badgeCriteria` object (defined in `src/badgeCriteria.js`), which defines the criteria for each badge. The application checks these criteria during gameplay and awards badges accordingly. The awarded badges are then displayed on the results screen.
